    <p ><b style="color: #700672;">Are you a Psychology student? Are you looking fora good Psychology internship
        which will help you gain knowledge?</b> <p style="color: #0f0d0f;">If yes then well you are at a right place, by the
            end of this blog you will get answers for all of these questions.</p></p>

    <p style="color:#0f0d0f";> Just having a good degree is not enough in today’s world, Pertinent work experience
        is now as valuable as our degrees and grades. Therefore, Internship nowadays has
        become an essential way to help candidates to stand out. </p>

<p style="color:#0f0d0f";>Hi, I’m Sneha, a psychology enthusiast currently pursuing BA (Hons) in
    Psychology. I have been searching for an internship since my first year of college, and
    honestly, I didn’t find any nice internship in psychology for free. Every internship I
    found was either not worth spending time on or we were asked to pay them to join as
    Intern.</p>

    <p style="color: #700672;"><b>Tell me, why do you want to join a company and foundation as an Intern?</b></p>



<p style="color:#0f0d0f";>For
    gaining practical knowledge and learning new skills which would help you in your
    future career right! Well Let me tell you one thing during this search of mine for a fine
    and dandy internship, I came across the HDF Foundation, a not-for-profit
    organization. Which works with delinquents, specially-abled youth, and the LGBTQI+
    community. They train their psychology interns to conduct training programmes for
    the youth. It was an intensive training programme where psychology interns were
    trained by the professionals in this field. It was like the icing on cake, an amiable
    institute plus free internship what else do you want?</p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">So before starting up with the internship we had to go through <b style="color: #700672;">2-3 weeks of 
    training.</b> This training program started with really light topics such as blogging, which
    slowly started taking complex but vital topics such as support groups. During this I
    learned a lot about the things I didn’t know, every day is new with new learning, new
    ideas, new topics.</p>

<p style="color: #700672; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> Training Program</p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;"> 
    Our training program started on a really nice note. Our <b style="color: #700672;">mentor was Nitin Shah</b>  who
    was really humble and supporting mentor introduced himself and just by that minimal
    talk anyone could say that one can always look up to him without any worry or fear of
    being judged. It wasn’t like I was the only one in the training session, there were about
    22 others with me and still no one ever felt left out and he never left a doubt back. This
    training program consist of different topics which I listed below:
</p>

<p><b style="color: #700672;">Topic 1: Blogging</b></p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">Blogging seems easy but trust me it isn’t. If you get into technicality, you will see
    creative writing, blogging is another sort of tension but Nitin sir made it look so easy,
    he told us various pointers to enhance our writing skills and to make blogging easy and
    more relatable. We learned about different parts of blogs and how to write them; like
    Blog format, ending etc.</p>

    <p><b style="color: #700672;">Topic 2: How to conduct Webinars</b></p>

    <p style="color: #0f0d0f;">If you want to grow in the psychology field you should know how to connect to
        people and how to conduct webinars. I believe as psychologists once in a while
        everyone has to conduct or attend webinars as host or guest, so it becomes essential
        for us to understand how to do it. And asper I have seen no organization teaching
        about how to conduct webinar and that too in such details.</p>

        <p><b style="color: #700672;">Topic 3: Talk it out Secession</b></p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">Before this secession I didn’t really know about talk it out secession, I used to consider
    Talk it out secession and support group same. But when I entered this session the first
    thing my mentor cleared was that these two things are different. We were explained in
    detail how to conduct a talk it out secession and were asked to write a script for the
    same. After that to make it clearer we were divided into groups and were asked to
    conduct secession among us turn by turn, which helped it get a better script and
    clarity about how to conduct the secession.</p>

    <p><b style="color: #700672;">Topic 4: Survey</b></p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">Surveys are an essential part for research papers, webinars, conduct support groups or
    even if you want to create an article to influence a vast audience. I
    never thought about surveys so much before, but during this session I came across
    them and how to conduct it in proper structured matter. They covered various topics
    like target audience, Topic, formats of questions etc.</p>

    <p><b style="color: #700672;">Topic 5: Support group</b></p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">Honestly this was the hardest part, but Nitin sir tried to cover every possible question
    and tried to simplify it for us. He explained every part of and gave examples in every
    bit. And even after all this for more clearance, he conducted 3
    secession support groups on brand building, crystallizing our thoughts about both the
    topic and how to conduct support groups. After that as an ending we were asked to
    write a whole flow for a support group leading to wrapping our head better around it.</p>

    <p style="color: #0f0d0f;">After this Training session I personally felt more confident and got a sense of
        professionalism, with a clear view of how to be in and manage the professional world.
        I just joined this internship for a certificate with a normal mindset but end up getting
        great knowledge and confidence to move forward in this line. It really initiated my
        Personal and Professional growth. I can say this internship is one of the best one can
        have if they want to attain knowledge and initiate
        self-development.</p>
