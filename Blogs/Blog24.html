<p style="color:#0f0d0f";>It has been assessed that at least </b style="color:#00032b ";>10 percent </b>of the global population is affected and that</b style="color:#00032b ";> 20 percent </b>of children and adolescents suffer from some type of mental disorder. For 2017. a study estimated that 792 million people lived with a mental health disorder. This is slightly more than</b style="color:#00032b ";> one in ten people</b> globally </b style="color:#00032b ";> (10.7%).</b> </p>
<p style="color:#0f0d0f";>These distressing statistics display the predominance of mental illness more ordinarily. It is estimated that mental health conditions will affect a tremendous one in four people at some time in their lives and hence we are all required to serve our share towards providing adequate help and support for assisting the ones struggling with mental health concerns. </p>
<p style="color:#0f0d0f";>Youth being a most active and effective component of the population can dynamically affect the stats just by -</p>
<ul style="color:#0f0d0f";>

    <li><b style="color:#092209";><u>Ask how others are doing. </u></b><br><br>
It's good to keep a track of how your friends and family are doing, it won't take much of your time to keep a regular check and just text or call them asking how they have been! It would make them know that they are still a part of your life, you still care about them and it can induce a sense of security and belongingness in them, guiding them to the happier side of life. </li><br>


<li><b style="color:#092209";><u>Initiate a conversation </u></b><br><br>
Communication is the key. Don't hesitate to initiate the conversations or to engage in appropriate conversation. If you find someone tensed, worried, anxious, behaving unusual, getting manic or depressed oddly, or even posting strange stuff on social media, then don't delay the conversation. You can simply ask them if these behaviors or posts are intentional or are something bothering them? if yes, try to be there for them, listen actively, and be empathetic. Helping an individual feel respected, accepted, and understood is essential in providing them with emotional support and understanding.</li><br>


<li><b style="color:#092209";><u>Encourage them to share how they feel. </u></b><br><br>
Checking in and talking can't help solely unless you can assure security and confidentiality. They may be worried, confused, or scared about what is happening. Talk openly about their problem and don't impose your prejudices, listen non-judgementally and try to get to a solution by placing yourself in their spot. It's essential to have open dialogues with them, acknowledge their questions, and reassure them that they are safe.</li><br>



<li><b style="color:#092209";><u>Voice hope and awareness</u></b><br><br>
Build awareness around prevailing mental health issues and preventions. Many people are adopting various online and offline campaigns assisting mental health issues, try to chain up with them, and if not you can spring it from your own house. Talk to your family, friend, and neighbor about if they are struggling through anything and let them know the signs and symptoms so that they can be consciously aware of what they are moving through. Take them to professionals if needed. Voice out hope, let others know that It's ok not to be ok! Let them know the significance of reaching out and venting during the tough times. </li><br>


<li><b style="color:#092209";><u>Provide practical help. </u></b><br><br>
If you find someone around you fighting such problems, try to assist them with practical help which can include not only taking them to seek professional help but also sustaining them with their daily activities. This can include helping to prepare healthy meals, motivating them for physical movements like walking, exercises, or meditation, engaging them in their favorite hobby or self-care activities, and talking through the next day's schedule.</li><br>


<li><b style="color:#092209";><u>Be a role model. </u></b><br><br>
Practice self-care and journaling to keep a record of your mental health too. This way you can inspire folks around you letting them know how these practices have been helping you so far. Achieve basic information on how to recognize signs and symptoms of a developing mental health challenge and to deal with them. Exercise self-discovery so you can not only encourage others but also be consciously aware of your mental health status, acknowledging various physical, mental, social, and emotional changes around you and your ones who are in need. </li><br>


<li><b style="color:#092209";><u>Encourage self-care. </u></b><br><br>
Everyone can't always know how to communicate changes in feeling and emotion or what they may need. Therefore, Encouraging self-care activities for your family as a whole can help them take care of their mental health. It is vital to recognize that any feelings of worry, fear, or anxiety anyone may have are normal. Nothing's worth more than your mental health.</li><br>

<li><b style="color:#092209";><u>Look for risk of suicide or harm</u></b><br><br>


When helping a person befalling through a mental health crisis, it is crucial to look for clues of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, self-injury, or other harm. Talking or writing about death, Feeling hopeless, Acting recklessly, or employing risky actions can be some of the warning signs. Always seek emergency medical help if the person's life is in immediate danger.</li><br>
