    <p style="color:#0f0d0f";> Nobody expects that a program joined to expand knowledge on mental health
        support, would actually benefit one’s own mental health. But this is what happened
        to me when I joined the internship program at ‘Healing Dove Foundation’ , along
        with ICHARS. </p>

<p style="color:#0f0d0f";>When I joined this program, I was on edge. I felt that I would have to learn so many
    things, out of which most are not my forte. But as is said ‘Don’t conclude without
    being associated and started’. Though I joined with a lot of questions, this program
    not only trained me but also helped me feel at peace and productive.</p>



<p style="color:#0f0d0f";>While attending this program, I could use my previous knowledge while learning
    new things. The idea that every step I take will eventually lead to a contribution in
    spreading awareness regarding mental health, served as a catalyst for my continuous
    motivation to work and learn more. The training period was the most enlightening
    one. There was an activity which gave me the confidence that I could actually do
    things and I should believe in myself. During the training, we all were asked to put a
    rough draft of a ‘Talk it out’ session. I was not confident. But since we were
    explained about what it is and how it works, I was ready to give it a try. That activity
    uncovered my ‘designing’ skill. I, along with my co-worker, was eventually able to
    bring out some innovative activities for the ‘Talk it out session’. At that moment, I
    realized that my nervousness sometimes makes me underestimate my own abilities.
    Thus, not only could I believe in myself a little more, but I could also learn with
    more peace and calmness. It added a positive point to my mental health.</p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">In this program, everyday I put forward a question in my mind, and in search of the
    answer to it, I was actually able to find answers to my previous unresolved queries
    which I had for a long time. And as I learnt more, I was filling myself with new
    learnings. Also the idea that these learnings would not only contribute to me or my
    co-workers, but to a large number of people, was something which added up to the
    number of reasons for being in the field of mental health. This made me feel how
    much it is needed and how much I can give back, which eventually improved my
    self-esteem to a significant level and gave me benefit in terms of my mental health
    improvement.</p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">The program did not focus on only one aspect of the field, but also integrated the
    related areas. It is not one of the programs where you are trained only in one area
    and are asked to stick to it. Instead, it is one where you are trained to work in all
    the areas related to the field, whether it is about putting your thoughts on a paper
    or creating a safe place for others to put forward their feelings and thoughts freely.
    It is not a program where you are trained only with words, but one where you are
    trained with actions and practice along with words.</p>

    <p style="color: #0f0d0f;">
        Each day, I would learn a new concept along with the way of applying it. And each
idea would bring out a positive outlook of the different things which are related to
it. This built up my confidence and belief in myself to try to keep on learning.</p>

        <p style="color: #0f0d0f;">I could use all the knowledge and learn not to underestimate myself. Therefore, it
            was just like filling myself each day to be able to pour out into others’ cups. This
            program helped me get acquainted with my hidden abilities, made me more skilled,
            and engraved new ways of seeing things. It all added to me being more comfortable
            and more competent, and cleared my doubts; which all contributed positively to my
            mental peace.</p>

        <p style="color: #0f0d0f;">I could now see a new and competent me in the mirror. I look forward to growing
            more and more as I continue to work with the organization. To become someone
            who can understand more, help more, and give more......</p>
