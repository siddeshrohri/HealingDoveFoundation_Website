<p style="color: #0f0d0f;"> 
    Egalitarianism is finding its way back from within the books to out-of-book actuality. Now more than ever, equality is becoming an alluring abstraction for which people are constantly disputing. The eternal trajectory of violence and inequality is far from over but, minorities find their way back into the respected clique. Seven billion people exist in the world, and every one of us has a unique identity. 

</p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">The struggle for the right to equality has been demanded by minorities since the beginning of times. Finally, decisions are being taken with humanity into consideration. In 1973, a similar action towards achieving equality was taken by American Psychiatric Association, when homosexuality was declassified as a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
</p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">A decision taken 44 years back set the momentum to a change that has brought about a massive collapse of the structure of gender identity and sexual orientation of people. Myriads of colours are seen on the streets when the LGBTQIA++ community stands tall with pride and self-love. They display to the world their stance and respect for themselves and their community. This journey may sound simple, but it comes after years of self-doubt and self-deprecating exploration. </p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">Mental health is a critically disregarded topic of discussion in terms of health. Poor mental health has many effects that are the same as physical health hazards, and yet, it is under-represented. Poor mental health can affect daily functioning concerning work, interpersonal relations, self-care, socialising, and much more. The sense of self is derived from gender identity and sexual orientation, which contours a substantial portion of mental health.
</p>

<p style="color:#0f0d0f">The normative society does not teach children that gender and sexual orientation is fluid. This lack of information boxes children from a very tender age, instilling in their fragile minds that anything beyond convention is immoral and questionable. Children explore their sexuality from early childhood and begin to form an identity soon after. The impression left by such ideologies not only confuses children but also damages their self-esteem and self-image. Naturally, the LGBTQIA++ community is challenged ever since childhood, the most delicate developmental period. </p>
   
<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">Familial structures are primal and pivotal in forming a person's identity, but sadly the LGBTQIA++ community faces prejudice from thereon. It is not simple to generalise, but looking at India specifically, the situation is further derogatory for these individuals. Slanders, insults, and bullying become a part of their daily life while growing up among peers. Mostly LGBTQIA++ identifiers are rejected from social groups and activities, which may be very detrimental to their mental health. Social rejection can severely impact emotions, cognition and physical health as well. Naomi Eisenberger, Kipling Williams, and colleagues (2003) found that social rejection activates several brain regions involved in physical pain. Therefore, we can only imagine what the community faces each day. The LGBTQIA++ community is rejected because of their identity, which is mentally disparaging.
</p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">The journey of an LGBTQIA++ individual begins with first understanding oneself, then coming out (a term used for the process that the LGBTQIA++ community use to accept and share that identity openly with other people) and educating others. Later, the community struggles to be seen as human and not unnatural. In this elongated process, they spend their entire lives constantly battling prejudices, discrimination, stigmatisation, and deterring mental health. LGBTQIA++ community is at a high risk of suffering from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder, so on. Additionally, they also form suicidal tendencies caused by malicious events that are caused by trauma and stigma. The rate of committing suicides are higher in transgender individuals, that of 30.8 per cent.</p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">LGBTQIA++ individuals are as normal as heterosexuals. Homosexuality is not a disorder or illness and not a "phase." It is an orientation, just like that of a heterosexual. Being LGBTQIA++ does not indicate impairment in perception, stability, dependability, or customary social or vocational capabilities. Lastly, LGBTQIA++ are born with this inclination and gender identity, they do not become gender variant in a trice.</p>


<p style="color: #0f0d0f;"> Society plays a particularly crucial role in the acceptance and growth of the LGBTQIA++ community. Simply by educating one another, we can normalise and de-stigmatise gender variance. Mental health is delicate, unlike physical conditions that can be cured with medicines. Poor mental health may plague and handicap a person for a lifetime. The trauma that one encounters leaves an imprint on the minds of individuals, leaving them scarred and devastated. We may not fight for LGBTQIA++ individuals, but we can support them and make them feel recognised, accepted, and safe. Rather than assuming whether they are he or she, we can ask for their pronouns. If we offend them in any way, the least we can do is apologise and accept our fault instead of abusing and vilifying them. </p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;"> Mental health is a subject that is not being talked about because of the stigma attached to it. This augments when we talk about the mental health of LGBTQIA++ individuals, as both terms are stigmatised. The LGBTQIA++ individuals are as human as heterosexuals are, and there is nothing unnatural about it. In the struggle of the LGBTQIA++ community, where they battle not only themselves but also the society, we can lend a hand and choose to be kind. LGBTQIA++ individuals are not indisposed in any way. As humans, we can join them and embrace them in their endeavour, so they stand tall, are proud of themselves, and find self-acceptance and love. By uplifting others, we become one.</p>
