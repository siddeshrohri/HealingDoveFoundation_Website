        Are you an intern too? <br><br>Are you also that type of person who reads about one’s experience before applying for an internship?<br><br> Do you also want to grow as well as learn in the same working space?
        </b> </p>

    <p style="color:#0f0d0f";> Well, I am that type of person who wants a positive working space where I can gain knowledge and gain experience as well. So here I will be sharing my experience with the Healing Dove Foundation (HDF) as an intern. Before you read my whole experience, I would really say that this internship changed my perspective about what I think about an ideal internship.
    </p>

<p style="color:#0f0d0f";>So, let me introduce myself, Hey! I am Jessica chawla and I have just completed my bachelor’s degree in applied psychology and right now I am pursuing my master’s degree in clinical psychology, and like everyone, I want to gain some experience in my field of interest, and one day as I was applying for various internships on Internshala I came across for this internship too. And honestly speaking their internship attracts me as they have a very great motive on which they are working which is “MANAGING THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS OF YOUTH”. So, I applied without any hesitation and I got a call for an interview the very next day, and I was very happy when I got selected. Well, I couldn't believe it for a few seconds, but when I received my offer letter I felt like I achieved something good.
</p>

   



<p style="color:#0f0d0f";>So before our main internship and training time period, they had a small virtual orientation program which was quite good. They cleared all our doubts and explained our roles and responsibilities in detail and moreover, our manager was a very calm and sweet person, or as I say that she is a great leader because When I talk to managers, I get the feeling that they are important. When I talk to leaders, I get the feeling that I am important.
</p>

<p style="color: #0f0d0f;">Then our internship proceeded, and I was very excited to attend the training program. The training program was for about 3 weeks, and it was given by Mr. Nitin Shah and the skills which they taught us were amazing, and I am definitely sure it will help us in our future. They trained us for many things which are highly recommended learning like how to conduct talk it out sessions, support groups, webinars, and how to increase your social media engagement. Yes, how can I forget to mention the positive atmosphere I felt in my internship. With this internship, I find a space where the mental health of my fellow interns and mine is the first priority to them.
    Every day in this internship it feels like a new, fresh day with something new to learn and experience. And genuinely, this internship helped in my self-development, build my confidence, and guided me on how to evolve as a psychologist.
    </p>



<p style="color: #0f0d0f;"> 
    Now I want you to ask yourself what else you want from your internship? Truly, I am very happy as well as satisfied that I opted for this internship, which helped me in my overall development.
    If I have to summarize my experience, I would say, it was an amazing internship with so many great people who taught us many very important things and yes, I will also say that my fellow interns were great too and had an amazing experience with working and networking with them.
