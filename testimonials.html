<p>&quot; Healing Dove Foundation is ICHARS Support Foundation&#39;s reach out partner, which means we connect with other NGOs through HDF anytime we work with them. HDF assists us in handling all of the follow-up and initial screening that is necessary of these NGOs in order for the collaborations to run successfully. Because of the HDF team&#39;s efforts to locate such NGOs and ensure that they are in line with our standards, our interactions with other NGOs have risen substantially, practically on a daily basis since we partnered with them. They also assist us in documenting and evaluating training programmes. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot; In terms of linking professionals with a mental health background with persons who require capacity building in MH problems, HDF is doing an excellent job. HDF has helped Sense India&#39;s experts (who work in the field of deafblindness) improve their competence in MH methods so that they can provide long-term counselling assistance to carers and people who are deafblind. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot; I worked as a Legal Intern and Team Leader at the Healing Dove Foundation. My group consisted of five individuals, all of whom were eager to learn and work hard. Ms. Nitika Nagar, my mentor, was really helpful and supportive in every manner, and Pakhi, my co-ordinator, was quite cooperative and nice. This made our job simpler to investigate by bringing any issues or ambiguity to the attention of my Co-ordinator and mentor. We had a fantastic learning experience, and everything was scheduled so we had time for everything. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot; Every activity at the Healing Dove Foundation entails learning. This workplace has a fantastic project to work on, but if you are new, you may be unsure of what to do next. The nicest part, in my opinion, is that they respect our time. They give time to think, time to complete work at our leisure, time to relax on weekends, and they work for a good purpose, which distinguishes them. &quot;</p>
